* Library of diode model parameters
*
* This is a reduced version of PSpice's diode model library.
* You are welcome to make as many copies of it as you find convenient.
*
* The parameters in this model library were derived from the data sheets for
* each part.  Most parts were characterized using the Parts option.
* Devices can also be characterized without Parts as follows:
*	IS		nominal leakage current
*	RS		for zener diodes: nominal small-signal impedance
*			at specified operating current
*	IB		for zener diodes: set to nominal leakage current
*	IBV		for zener diodes: at specified operating current
*			IBV is adjusted to give the rated zener voltage
*
*
*** Zener Diodes ***
*
* "A" suffix zeners have the same parameters (e.g., 1N750A has the same
* parameters as 1N750)
