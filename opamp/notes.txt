## Slew rate
Increasing the ratio W/L of the M8,M5, increase the slew rate. The L is 1um, so we change only the w.
Increasing the current I5 also increase the slew rate. But the previous has significant impact.
You need to keep in mind though, that the Ibias should be not very high because then the gain will be lower.
So probably the best option is to play with the ratio of the M8, M5. What about m7? Nothing regarding slew rate

For W = 5u and L=1u, we have around 22 in the slew rate and Iac = 15u. We can probably increase it more either the W or the Iref. But we need to ensure that it doesnt conflict with others.

Μιας και τον σημαντικότερο ρόλο παίζουν τα Μ8, Μ5 για το slew rate, έχω την εντύπωση ότι τα Ι1,2,3,4 είναι αυτά που επηρεάζουν το slew rate.

# Gain

M!, M2, increase the L and at the same the time the ratio W/L. This will result to increase the gain. I tried to change ht M8,M5 ratio but gain didnt change, current source too.

Increasing the aforementioned in the slew rate didnt change the gain!

Lowering the W of M7, increased the gain too. Αυτό παίζει και να βοήθησε το slew rate να βελτιωθεί. Μπα πολυ λιγο. O Cc έκανε την δουλειά. Άρα για slew rate έχουμε Μ8,5, πηγή ρεύματος και πυκνωτής. Ο πυκνωτής το phase margin. Τα Μ1,2 και Μ7 το gain.

## Phase margin

1pf -> 0.7 pF, lead us to -119 when zero db. This is 60 phase margin!
